                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I have been in love with coding from a young age—my dad works in the field of computer science, and his passion for coding sparked my own. 
                    Ever since, I’ve loved coding, 
                    learning new technologies, and challenging myself with new projects. I specialize in Python, HTML, and CSS and I am also currently learning Java.
                    I’m currently looking for internship opportunities to showcase my skills and to gain real-world 
                    experience and to grow as a developer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I’m someone who values connection and curiosity. I’m always eager to learn from the people around me and embrace new experiences. 
                    Whether it’s through participating in community events or taking on new projects, I strive to make the most of every opportunity to grow. 
                    I’m a strong believer in teamwork and enjoy being part of a group where everyone contributes their unique perspectives. 
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new hobbies, and making new friends—always with an open mind and a positive attitude.
